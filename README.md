## AWS Config custom policy rule samples

This repository contains a collection of sample custom policy rules for AWS Config. The samples are designed to educate AWS customers on how to build custom AWS Config rules written using Guard which is a domain specific language (DSL). They are organized by various resources for AWS Config to return compliance in line with the rule definition.  We will continue to add more rules to this repository as they are developed and verified.
